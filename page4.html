    <p>The AP Program is recognized internationally, with over twenty-two thousand schools registered,
      and over one million graduates in total. The program encourages its participants to develop their skills
      in an environment more challenging than usual classes.
      
      <br><br>
      Students who study in AP classes study to prepare for university-level courses, starting right from the beginning of their junior year.
      Pre-AP begins in grades 9 and 10, which prepares them for the 
      The exams that are given by the end of their 12th grade are accepted by universities and colleges worldwide. 
      

      <br><br>
      Students who pass the AP Exam with more than or equal to a mark of 3 &#40approx&#46 60&#37&#41 have a chance to skip the lowest course in that area of study, if that
      school allows it.

      <br><br>
      The program, of course, follows every areas' cirriculum, but is altered in a way that benefits the students
      so that they learn more than they usually would.

      <br><br>
      Each AP Exam is given out by the school's head of department &#40or the person with the highest authority&#41
      and marked by faculty members anonymously. The exam itself is made by the math specialists in the <em>Advanced Placement</em>
      company, and is reviewed by teachers in the University of Silicon, the prestegious university that this company is situated in.

    <p>The Advanced Placement Program offers many advantages with its students.

      <br><br>
      One of these benefits is the introduction of segregated &#40apart from traditional&#41 classes, with experienced teachers that have been 
      taught AP-course specifics in order to provide students with a supportive and challenging atmosphere to test their own limits with the
      resources we give to them.
